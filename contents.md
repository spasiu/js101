# Math

## Expressions

If you type a number into the REPL, it'll echo it back to you. That's because the REPL always tells you what value is produced by an expression, and your number is a very simple mathematical expression.

## Operators

You can do arithmetic in JavaScript the same way as you would with a paper and pen. 1 + 1 = 2. But in JavaScript we can just do the `1 + 1` part, and the [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_computing) computes `2`.

Here are some math operators you're familiar with:

Operator | Name     | Example | Output
---------|----------|---------|--------
`+`      | add      | `2 + 2` | `4`
`-`      | subtract | `2 - 2` | `0`
`*`      | multiply | `2 * 2` | `4`
`/`      | divide   | `2 / 2` | `1`
`%`      | [remainder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Remainder) | `2 % 2` | `0`

The only one that may need any explanation is [remainder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Remainder). The expression `2 % 2` gives you the remainder of two divided by two, `0`.

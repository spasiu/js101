# Tools
We really only need two tools to get started:
1. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) (the browser)
2. [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) (the text editor)

You want to know how to use the console in Chrome developer tools. Here's a [helpful resource](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/).

In Atom.io you want to install a linter. A linter tells you when you make mistakes while you're writing code. Here's what you need:
- [How to install a package in Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/)
- [The linter package](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint)
- [The linter-eslint package](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint)

Here are some optional resources:
- A [free course](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/) on using Chrome Dev tools
- An extremely [beginner friendly tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWwBQQOGllo) for learning how to use Atom. You're interested in getting to videos 10 and 11 where you learn how to install packages and linters.

## REPL

REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop.
[A REPL](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13612824/1588728) is a tool you can use to program interactively. Chrome's developer console is a REPL. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript) is another REPL, which also lets you write scripts on the left-hand side.

Go play with a REPL.
